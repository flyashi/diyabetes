# Welcome to DIYabetes

I'm an engineer at heart, recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. We live in the future! The technology available today is absolutely miraculous, and the possibilities it opens up for treatment and management are were simply unimaginable just a few short years ago.

Besides what's provided by medical companies, here's some things I did myself. If you find them useful, great! Please feel free to use them for yourself. If you have updates and more things you made that you want to share, amazing! Let's all help each other.
