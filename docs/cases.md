## Dexcom G6 receiver belt clip

The Dexcom G6 receiver is a very handy, palm-sized device that can display sensor readings, including graph and change arrows, as well as notify in case of highs, lows, rapid changes, etc. In order to make this device easily accessible when needed, here is a holder with belt clip that you may find handy.

And here's a version that slides onto the unofficial "quick-draw" holster case, though the current version slides off too easily. This version was made in Fusion 360:
