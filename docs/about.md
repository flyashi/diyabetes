# About

## History

I'm a computer engineer by day, and these devices have helped me personally and hopefully they'll be useful to others as well.

## Availability

These are not (yet?) available for purchase, but they are available for you to make your own! All design and source files are provided.

## Help Wanted

If you are a designer or developer, please be in touch.
